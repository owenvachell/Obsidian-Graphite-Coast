# My Obsidian Themes
Putting together some custom CSS themes for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Details below.

## Licence
Re-use/edit as you wish. Attribution appreciated but not necessary.

## Installation
1. Turn off any themes already in use.
2. Create a `snippets` directory in the `.obsidian` directory inside your vault. You may need to turn on viewing for hidden directory's if the `.obsidian` directory isn't visible.
3. Download any of the css files from this repo to the `snippets` directory just created.
4. Go to the `Appearance` settings in Obsidian.
5. Scroll to the bottom and enable/reload snippets.

## red-coast
Custom Obsidian CSS with WYSIWYM editor, inspired by Red Graphite and California Coast themes

### Attribution
I don't consider myself a CSS developer. I know enough to get the things done that I need/want, albeit not necesseraily in the most code efficient way. So this theme contains a few snippets from those more talented in the CSS arena than I am in the Obsidian community. To acknowledge them, I wanted to put this attribution section high up this page, rather than buried at the bottom. 

As mentioned, the original inspiration for this theme came from Red Graphite (font and accent colour) and California Coast (minimalist approach with lots of white space). Many thanks to seanwcom ([Red Graphite](https://github.com/seanwcom/Red-Graphite-for-Obsidian)) and mgmeyers ([California Coast](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-california-coast-theme))

- (modified) WYSIWYM editor - **Piotr**
- auto fades status bar - **rsdimitrov**
- Add quotation character before quote - **Thery**
- bigger link popup preview - **_ph**
- outliner for the outline - **Shamama**
- list relationship lines - **Obsidian forum** (this appears in a lot of places, it's difficult to identify the original author). Modified to only work with preview mode. Recommend the outliner plugin and enable the 'Improve the style of your lists' setting for relationship lines in edit mode. 

*Changed list relationship lines to only show in preview mode as they didn't work properly in edit mode. If anyone is able to fix this, please let me know. (See issues)*
