### Attribution
I don't consider myself a CSS developer. I know enough to get the things done that I need/want, albeit not necesseraily in the most code efficient way. So this theme contains a few snippets from those more talented in the CSS arena than I am in the Obsidian community. To acknowledge them, I wanted to put this attribution section high up this page, rather than buried at the bottom. 

As mentioned, the original inspiration for this theme came from Red Graphite (font and accent colour) and California Coast (minimalist approach with lots of white space). Many thanks to seanwcom ([Red Graphite](https://github.com/seanwcom/Red-Graphite-for-Obsidian)) and mgmeyers ([California Coast](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-california-coast-theme))

## Installation
1. Turn off any themes already in use.
2. Create a `snippets` directory in the `.obsidian` directory inside your vault. You may need to turn on viewing for hidden directory's if the `.obsidian` directory isn't visible.
3. Download any of the css files from this repo to the `snippets` directory just created.
4. Go to the `Appearance` settings in Obsidian.
5. Scroll to the bottom and enable/reload snippets.

### Changing accent colours
1. Open the red-coast.css with any text editor
2. Find `--light-accent` to change the red accent in the light theme, or `--dark-accent` to change the gold in the dark theme. Both light and dark accent values are near the top of the file
3. Replace the # value with your preferred hex or rgb/rgba colour value
4. Save the file. You may also need to reload the theme from Obidian's appearance settings.
